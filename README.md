This repo implements a MATLAB code for particle filtering developed by Lidia Al-Zogbi and Edmond Elburn as part of a class project. The data is publicly available on CALCE website, as well as in this repository. Further instructions and cleaned up comments will be added soon.

Some resampling algorithms were found online and we used them for comparison purposes, further details will be added later on.
